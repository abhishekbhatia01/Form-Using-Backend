Our team developed a form using Node.js and Express.js as the backend framework. The form allows users to submit data, which is validated and securely stored. This project demonstrates how a backend handles form submissions, processes data, and ensures everything runs smoothly. Using Node.js and Express.js made it easy to manage routes, handle requests, and build a reliable server. It was a collaborative effort to apply what weâ€™ve learned about backend development and create a functional system.
